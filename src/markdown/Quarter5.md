## Class Review 

After finishing all my finals this winter, I thought it was a good time to revisit all the classes I've taken so far (Fall 2023 - Winter 2025) as a small project during break.

Here's a list of classes I've taken, in the order of my reviews.

- ASIA AM 10W

- LS 15
- MATH 32B

- CS 35L
- MATH 131AH
- MATH 134
- MATH 170A
- MATH 180
- CS 111

### Fall 2023
**History of Asian Americans (ASIA AM 10W)** - I really liked the Professor, Keith Camacho, and the guest speakers he brought in for one lecture. The content was alright and there was a ton of reading and writing (as expected from a Writing II class). I don't really remember much from the class, but I still vividly recall Camacho watching me fall asleep in lecture and that he would cold call on people. 

**Multivariable Calculus Part I (MATH 32A)** - Multivariable is a pretty interesting topic. Lectures were alright, and Professsor Kofi was a really interesting guy, but I think I could've learned everything by just reading the textbook instead of going to lecture. I remember having 20 questions of HW every week (that were listed as mandatory on the syllabus) but it was never graded, though allegedly it was just my lecture (and probably my TA).

**Intro to CS (CS 31)** - I taught myself some C++ during the summer following a video game in C++ Youtube Series, so learning the syntax and pointers (argubly the hardest part of CS 31) wasn't too difficult for me. I did pretty poorly on the labs though, but I did really well on the midterms and finals since I understood the content. I think it's perfectly find to take this class on cycle if you have some experience with CS. For reference, my background before coming to UCLA was just AP CS A (which I did pretty well on), but do note that on-cycle CS 31 and 32 are a lot more work than off-cycle.

### Winter 2024

**Lower Division Linear Algebra (MATH 33A)** - Arant was an amazing professor, and he made linear algebra really interesting. Taking Linear and Discrete at the same time made me really love math. When we started talking about adjacency matrices in Discrete (and the theorem about powers of adjacency matrices), I almost had the same sensations as when I would look at Lebron. I would definitely recommend taking a class with Arant.

**Discrete Structures (MATH 61)** - I also loved Discrete. I think the highlight of the class was my TA, Ariana. Though I didn't go to all the discussions, I really liked hearing her talk about math, and I think I learned more about Discrete from her than the professor. I recall that all the questions on Midterm 1 were on the practice midterms that the professor shared which was pretty goated. My nose also remembers the stench of the person sitting in the row in front of me during the Final :(

**Data Structures + Algorithms in C++ (CS 32)** - I think it's worth taking CS 32 wth Nachenberg. It really is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have a professor that as entertaining and out of pocket as Nachenberg, and I retained a lot of what he taught. I thought project 3 and 4 weren't actually that difficult, just a bit tedious, and I am glad I did everything without ChatGPT, since actually thinking about data structures and algorithm to implement that projects helped a lot with the midterms and finals. As for Nachenberg vs Smallberg debate, I would say enroll in either, and try to attend as many Nachenberg lectures as you can, but Smallberg's lectures are also great. 

**Mechanics (PHYSICS 1A)** - I was kinda scared of taking physics since I hadn't touched physics since freshman year high school, but the class wasn't that difficult. The experiments and live examples that Kusenko would do made the lectures pretty engaging, but I really didn't like how we would have to do questions from his textbook website during lecture. The TA was also super knowledgeable so waking up for the 9AM discussions turned out to be a great decision.

### Spring 2024

**Life Science Concepts (LS 15)** - This was the best GE I've taken so far. All GE's should strive to be like LS 15. I thought it was the perfect amount of work for a class that wasn't a major requirement, and the content itself was fascinating. A big reason why this class was so amazing was because of Professor Phelan. He was super passionate about teaching the topic, and it made going to lectures so worth it. I also loved my TA and he made discussions fun and interactive as well. There is a mandatory debate in dicussions, but it didn't feel like busy work.

**Multivariable Calculus II (MATH 32B)** - A lot of people were telling me that this class was a lot harder than Math 32A, but I didn't really think it was that much harder. I think if you understand Calculus 2 (Math 31B), then the integration and Greenes Theorem parts of Multivariable won't be that hard. Though lectures were a bit boring, Yeong knew her stuff and the lecture notes were a really great resource. The worksheets we did during discussion really solidified my knowledge of what we were doing in class and really appreciated the LA's helping out with that. On a side note, my TA, Sam, was a quite interesting feller, and I could tell he really loved math.

**Differential Equations (MATH 33B)** - Probably the lightest Math class I've ever taken. If you want to actually learn differential equations, don't take this class with Professor Chenxi Wang or take an upper division Diff Eq course. 

**Computer Organization (CS 33)** - This was my favorite class out of the CS 31-33 series. It was really different than the rest of the series, but learning about lower level programming concepts was quite eye-opening. The LA-led discussions were really great, and the final review session with "escape Boelter Hall" activity was really fun. Reinman is a great lecturer (though he told us that we were his last CS 33 class for a while) and I couldn't help but admire his great physique. I really enjoyed the labs, especially the Attack and Bomb labs. 

### Fall 2025

**Russian Civilization in the 20th Century (RUS 90B)** - The mandatory attendence (sign-in sheet) was quite annoying, but the content was pretty fire. I wasn't really interested in Russian History prior to taking the class, but I learned a lot and Professor Shneyder thoughts on the topic were quite insightful. This class also had no midterm or final test (there was a final project).

**Honors Upper Division Linear Algebra (MATH 115AH)** - I heard great things about this class from my Applied Math friend, who took the class Spring quarter, so I was quite excited to take the class. This course was the first class in more abstract math I've taken, and learning about the "lower-level" foundations of Math, though maybe not applicable to the jobs I want to pursue in the future, was really intellectually stimulating. Though I nearly had 10-20 hours of homework every week (it peaked at 15 proof-based questions with multiple parts one), doing every homework was incredibly fulfilling and solified the ideas introduced in lecture. I thought Professor Conley was an amazing lecturer and Jas an incredible TA, and I definitely recommend taking any math lecture with him. From what I've seen with the Winter 2025 Math 115AH class, the professor for this class  matters a lot. 

**Algorithms (MATH 182)** - I took this class instead of CS 180 because one was an 8AM and the other was a 2PM course (guess which one was which). A lot of the ideas we learned were concepts I've seen in Leetcode problems before, so the class wasn't as interesting as I thought it would've been. I also think Professor Vicaria could have approached the topics slightly differently, since I felt pretty disengaged during lecture, but my TA, Nikita, completely made up for it (though I am salty he didn't read my regrade request on the Final). Looking back, I think I would have learned more if I took CS 180, and I slightly regret not doing so, since I'm pretty the lectures in that class were recorded.

**Software Construction (CS 35L)** - I didn't get the traditional Eggert experience for this class. Min Gao was an alright lecturer and he got better as the quarter progressed. I'm not sure if many share my perspective on this class, but I really enjoyed how we were able to go through so much random ahh content in this class. Learning the lower-level Git concepts was probably the best part of the curriculum, and working on the quarter-long server/client project was pretty fun, since my team was really on top of everything. Looking back, I really appreciate the time my teammates put into the project, since my friend in Creative Labs showed me the commit history of his project, and it lowkey looked like an Exponential Distribution. This class on top of the Math 115AH homework was really overwhelming, but I definitely don't regret taking it. 

### Winter 2025 

**Honors Real Analysis I (MATH 131AH)** - If I sat in the front of the class, deleted Instagram off my iPad, and perhaps took notes on a notebook, I think I would have appreciated this class a lot more. I realized the night before the final, when I was reading all 110 pages of lecture notes, that Analysis and Topology is a pretty interesting field. The precision behind normal math like limits and even constructing the rationals and real numbers is so peculiar, yet satisfying once finding the correct value to set epsilon to. I needed a lot of ChatGPT to do the homework, which is probably unoptimal since I'm taking another quarter of Analysis in the spring, and I thought the homework was quite a bit more tedious than the Linear Algebra problem sets. Professor Menz was a really funny guy and the lecture notes he used were amazing, but I thought he went through the proofs way too quickly. Perhaps, it was because I might have been possibly "watching reels" or looking over at the guy next to me playing some tower defense Roblox game, but a lot of the quarter felt like me trying to catch up to the current lecture, since I was always rereading the lecture notes to understand what was going on. 

**Dynamical Systems (MATH 134)** - I added this class during week 1, because it didn't seem like too much work. The highlight of this course was the TA, Eric. I went to his office hours to ask about something on the homework, and he was super helpful, and even ended up sending a follow up email on a question I had. Professor Kashefi was alright, though I had some difficulties staying engaged in lecture and understanding the underlying theory behind what he was teaching. Moreover, his handwriting was completely legible, but it was quite bizarre since he would dot his c's and s's. Out of all the upper division classes I've taken so far, I think this class has been the easiest, and I recommend taking it with a few harder classes. 

**Probability Theory I (MATH 170A)** - When people asked me what classes I was taking this quarter and I told them Math 170A, they would always ask me what it was. Math 170A is equivalent to Math 170E, Stats 100A, and ECE 131A, but with an emphasis on Theory rather than application. The first few weeks, we learned about sigma algebras and how probability concepts like inclusion/exclusion and memoryless processes are built on top of these structures. We also learned briefly about convolutions and generating functions. The majority of the final tested on these more abstract concepts (which I didn't study for, whoops) so I think that's what makes Math 170A different from the other probability courses offered at UCLA. Although I probably did really poorly in this course (final hasn't been graded as of now), I think this was the right choice over Math 170E for me. Learning a more rigorous approach to probability was a lot more engaging than what I think 170E would've taught. Those who know about this class know that Math 131A (Analysis I) is a pre-requisite, but the content didn't need much analysis. It was pretty much only used in definining measures, and being precise with sigma algebras. I hadn't taken analysis prior to enrolling in this class, but it was pretty easy to enroll in the class after a quick email to the professor and a visit to the undergraduate math advisors office. Nikita was my TA for this class as well, and the brain-teasers he pulled from his quant interviews were pretty fun.

**Graph Theory (MATH 180)** - The Graph theory unit in Math 182 was my favorite part of that course, so I wanted to give Graph Theory a shot. The class was much more challenging than I had anticipated and probably took a year off my life stressing about Midterm 2 and the final. Professor Nienhaus was not bad and his handwriting was beautiful. The lectures on Sperner's lemma, Ramsey Theory, and graphs on different topologies were engaging, but not much of anything else.

**Operating Systems (CS 111)** - I took this class since I wanted to make the most of the UCLA CS department as a Mathematics of Computation major. I was also pretty interested in Operating Systems after taking CS 33 and 35L. The class was lowkey underwhelming, since it focused more on theory. I did horrendous on the projects (even though the averages were in the high 90s) because of some very silly mistakes, but they weren't that difficult and didn't require much thinking. The class is pretty much follows the OSTEP textbook, and lectures aren't really required if you read every chapter.  


## Fun Analysis/Topology Proof
Here's my favorite problem from Math 131AH. Let F ⊆ R be a closed set bounded above. Show that sup F ∈ F. 

**Proof by contradiction:** Let a = sup F. Assume that a not in closure of F, \bar{F}. Then a ∈ complement of closure of F, (\\bar{F})^C. The complement of the closure of F is equal to the interior of the complement of A, (A^C)^O. So, there exists a r > 0 such that Br(A) ⊆ complement of A, A^C. This implies that there exists a b such that a-r < b < a and b ∈ complement of A and b > f ∈ F. However, this contradicts that a = sup F, since b < a, b is not in F, and b is an upper bound for F. Hence, a must be in the closure of F, and since the closure of F is equal to F in a closed set, this means sup F ∈ F.

## Honors Classes
My first impression on the upper division honors series was something along the lines of what [Scottie Barnes once "said"](https://www.tiktok.com/@bleacherreport/video/7325101458968382751?lang=en)—that the people in the classes are really smart. Ever since middle school, I've always felt like I was on the better side of the curve in every Math class I've taken. Even in my first year classes taking the Math 32-33 series and Math 61, I was comfortably above the average.

But the people in the Honors math courses were a completely different breed. It was analagous to what Celtics Legend Brian Scalabrine said to some hecklers: "I'm closer to Lebron than you are to me." It was like they were on the path to become the next Terry Tao's and I was going to flipping burgers in McDonalds with a worthless CS degree. As one does, I looked up their Linkedin profiles (in Linkedin's incognito mode) and a lot of them were ICPC kids, who did AMC/AIME and USACO in high school. Others donned the Regent's Scholar Society shirts. As expected, everybody was incredibly accomplished. 

The classes themselves were really challenging and dense. A ten-week quarter is not nearly enough time to go into every topic in Linear Algebra or Analysis in depth. In the two honors classes I've taken so far (three if you consider 170A the honors version of probability), the honors curriculum would try to fit in two or three more units on top of the normal curriculum. In 115AH, it was Linear Functionals and the Spectral Theorem. In 131AH, it was dedekind cuts and topology. In 170A, it was sigma algebras, generating functions, and convolutions. 

The homework problem sets in these classes were practically a part time job. As mentioned in my class reviews, 115AH homework took me on average 10-20 hours a week with the help of ChatGPT (since I wanted to try proofs myself first before getting help). A problem would take me on average an hour to complete, and the majority of it was just thinking about how I would approach the proof. Completing the homeworks was really rewarding, however, and I would recommend anyone that takes an upper division math class to try completing all the homework.

All in all, I believe that anyone can be successful in Honors classes. I am exaggerating a little bit, since a lot of the proofs require some creativity, intuition on how to approach a proof, and a ton of memorization of theorems. However, a lot of this is just effort and practice, and I think anyone interested in taking Honors classes is "smart" and creative enough to do well in the class if they truly put in the effort. Another big part of taking honors classes is genuinely being interested in learning math. Linear Algebra felt really enjoyable since I had a real interest in learning more about it. I probably should have taken normal Real Analysis, since I now know that I don't like the proofs, but I had no prior knowledge of Analysis and was curious about learning more about it. 

TLDR: honors classes are very rewarding but also very time consuming. If you want to try taking an Honors class, definitely take Math 115AH with Will Conley!

## Concluding Thoughts 
Professors matter, and take classes you actually want to take!
